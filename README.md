# romance.js 

Romance.js is my final project for Fullstack Academy's Bootcamp Prep program. I built a poem generator with a Markov chain that takes a word corpus and constructs a poem with a given number of lines and words per line. 

I wanted to include some ES6 and recursion in my solution, which are both are fairly new to me, and I think they work really well here.

A final note: most Markov chain poetry generators create texts that don't sound human at all. Since we were feeding our generators romantic poetry, I thought I should give my project a little style and polish. So I also added the restriction that none of the lines can end with a preposition, conjunction, or article. 

Good news â€” I won the award for most human-sounding poem!
